# Front-end

Front-end for some properties websites.

## Installation

You'll need **node** & **npm** installed to build the project.

```bash
npm install -g webpack             # install webpack globaly
npm install -g webpack-dev-server  # and this
npm install -g json-server         # need for faked api
npm install
```

This would download required dependencies. Next you could run project in development
mode or just build required `js` files:

```bash
npm run build  # build project
npm run dev    # launch webpack devserver with hot reloading
```

## DevTools

DevTools are available and could be activated by `ctrl-h` in your browser.
