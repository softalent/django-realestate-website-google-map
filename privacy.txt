<h5>When you use the Services, we collect a variety of information.</h5>

This may occur, for example, when you register on the Services, claim a home, correspond with a real estate agent via the Services, or complete other forms, such as a loan request. You may also provide information about a third party through the Services, for example, if you share a real estate listing with a recipient via email. We may combine this information with other information we collect from your interaction with the Services or from other companies.</p>

<p>In addition, when you order products or services through the Services, See This Property Group may collect your credit/debit card information.

<p>In the event that a credit report is required to use a Service, See This Property Group may collect your Social Security number ("SSN").
